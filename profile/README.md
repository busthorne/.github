## About

At the brink of a revolution in computing, where the promises are ambiguous, and the stakes are high, the looming presence of Large Language Models (LLMs) simply can't be ignored. In our humble opinion, and despite what news organisations would lead you to believe, the future doesn't amount to mere reshuffling or consolidation of the power structures, but brings a transformative spin to a special power of the human mind â€“ computing the knowledge and context that surrounds us. One of the ways people create, compile, share and wield information is by storytelling, and current developments allow our species to transfer this ability onto autonomous systems, creating a revolutionary way of program deployment through a natural language. Come think of it, creating computer programmes was always in it's core a way of telling stories, and today we're simply returning to the old ways.

In Busthorne, we value the decentralisation it entails. Our approach is inspired by the mastery of putting words into sentences, sentences into meanings, meanings that emerge as a result of following the rules of language games. The way LLMs take part in such games is through dialogue with the user. This conversation doesn't even need to be written by both parties â€“ when using txt2img diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, the prompt becomes a riddle, untangled both by a model ( it presents a picture based solely on vague description of vibes) and by the user themselves ( seeing the result forces new interpretation of the prompt ).  Such communication warrants collaboration, each actor tries to perform their given role, the language game is thus a play, and interface for back-and-forth exchanges is simply a stage on which it happens.

AI-human interaction, if only new, already has it's own traditions. Consider the environment where these interactions take place. Current interfaces, primarily chat-based, reduce the rich tapestry of interactions to a series of text bubbles â€“ a format that struggles to capture the depth and nuance of the performance unfolding between participants. Yet for centuries, humanity has already perfected a format that elegantly structures dialogue, action, and context: the dramatic script. It answers the fundamental questions of interaction â€“ who speaks, to whom, where, and when â€“ while maintaining clarity and flow. This realisation made us concentrate our attention on Intelligent Form.

Intelligent Form is, at its essence, a dynamic text format that transforms how users experience AI-generated content. At it's core it operates on two levels.  On the surface, akin to traditional literature, it consists of both substance (content) and form (means of transmission). In conventional playwriting, an author computes the narrative elements - characters, plot, and environment - before crystallizing them into a script. An introduction of LLMs into the process shifts the dynamic, the substance remains, however the form becomes ever-changing, presents as a living document that evolves with each interaction. Like a play's script, it provides clear visual and structural cues about who is speaking, what actions are being taken, and in what context â€“ but unlike a traditional script, it responds and reshapes itself based on user input. This dramatic format isn't just an aesthetic choice; it's a fundamental rethinking of how we can visualize and interact with AI responses, making the exchange more intuitive and expressive, allows for seamless interaction between humans and AI agents.
