Despite what news organisations would lead you to believe, the future doesn't amount to mere reshuffling or consolidation of the power structures. Think about it this way: people create, compile, share and wield information by means of storytelling. The current developments, first and foremost, have to do with this more than anything.

Our approach is inspired by the author's mastery of putting words into sentences, sentences into meanings, meanings that emerge as a result of following the rules of language games. Most notably, a language game doesn't necessarily entail dialogue how we know it; in diffusion models like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion, the prompt itself is a language-riddle being untangled by all parties: the result is a picture based solely on the description and its vibes, and leads to novel interpretations of the prompt.

To play, or not to playâ€”that is the question.
